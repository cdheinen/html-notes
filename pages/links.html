        <!-- Anchor Elements -->
        <h2>Anchor Elements</h2>

        <p>
            An anchor element is defined using the 'a' tag. The 'href' (hypertext reference) 
            attribute defines the destination of the link. The following link will take you
            to The Odin Project About page.
        </p>

        <p>Example Link: <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" rel="'noreferrer">About The Odin Project</a></p>

        <!-- Target Attribute -->
        <h3>Target Attribute</h3>

        <p>
            The above link opens The Odin Project About page in the current tab of the browser. 
            To open the link in a new tab, we need to add the 'target' attribute. If the 'target'
            attribute is not specified, it will take on the '_self' value by default. Which will
            open the link in the current tab. To open the link in a new tab (or window), set the
            'target' attribute to '_blank'.
        </p>

        <p>
            Example Link (that will open in new tab): 
            <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="'noreferrer">About The Odin Project</a>
        </p>

        <!-- Rel Attribute -->
        <h3>Rel Attribute</h3>

        <p>
            The 'rel' attribute is used to describe the relationship between the current page and
            the linked document. The 'noopener' attribute ensures that a link opened in a new tab 
            or window cannot interact with or access the original page. Without it, the new page
            can use JavaScript to manipulate the original page, which is a security risk.
        </p>

        <p>
            The 'rel' attribute can also be set to 'noreferrer', which will prevent new pages
            from knowing where the user came from by hiding the referrer, in addition to implementing
            the behavior provided by 'noopener'.

        <!-- Types of Links -->
        <h2>Types of Links</h2>

        <h3>Absolute Links</h3>

        <p>
            An absolute link is a link to pages on other websites on the internet.
            An absolute link typically takes the form 'schema://domain/path'.
        </p>

        <h3>Relative Links</h3>

        <p>
            A relative link is a link to pages on our own website. Relative links do
            not include a domain because it assumes that the domain is the same as the
            current page. Here is an example relative link that will take you back to
            the homepage: <a href="../index.html">Homepage</a>.
        </p>
