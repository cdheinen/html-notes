        <h1>Images</h1>

        <p>
            Images can be displayed in HTML using the 'img' element. Note that this is a
            void element, meaning it does not need a closing tag because it is naturally
            empty and only defined using the element attributes.
        </p>

        <p>
            The image that will be displayed is defined within the 'src' attribute of the 
            'img' element. Similar to the 'href' attribute of an anchor element, the 'src'
            attribute specifies the location of the image to be displayed, which can be both
            an absolute link or a relative link.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here is an example of an absolute link image:
        </p>

        <p><img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png" alt="The Odin Project logo"></p>

        <p>
            Here is an example of a relative image. Note that this image is stored
            locally within the 'images' directory:
        </p>

        <p><img src="../images/dog.jpg" alt="random dog"></p>
        
        <!-- Alt Attribute -->
        <h3>Alt Attribute</h3>
        <p>
            The 'alt' attribute of an 'img' element is used to provide alternate text
            for an image. This text will be displayed in place of an image if the image
            is unable to be loaded. It is also used for accessibility to describe the
            image to visually impared users.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here is an example image element where the image cannot be loaded. Note that
            the browser simply displays the value of the 'alt' attribute, which is set to
            'test alternative image text' in this example.
        </p>

        <p><img src="/path/that/does/not/exist" alt="test alternative image text"></p>

        <!-- Size Attributes -->
        <h3>Size Attributes</h3>

        <p>
            The 'height' and 'width' attributes can be used within the 'img' element to
            ensure that the image is rendered with proper sizing and ratios.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here is The Odin Project logo with alternate sizing:
        </p>

        <p><img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png" alt="The Odin Project logo" height="100" width="310"></p>
